# Automatic-Street-Light-Control
My project is Automatic Street Light Control. With the help of an IR Sensor, we will control the street light. So when any person is walking the street light above the person will automatically turn on because of the sensor it triggered. I will simulate my project using Proteus and for the coding, I will be using Keil.
There are 3 sensors in our project. If you want, we can increase the number of parking slots by adding a few more IR sensors and modifying the code accordingly.
