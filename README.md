# Automatic-Street-Light-Control
My project is Automatic Street Light Control. With the help of an IR Sensor, we will control the street light. So when any person is walking the street light above the person will automatically turn on because of the sensor it triggered. I will simulate my project using Proteus and for the coding, I will be using Keil.
